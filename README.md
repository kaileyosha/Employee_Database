# Employee_Database
## Overview
The purpose of this project was to help Pewlett-Hackard with determining the number of employees that are eligibile for retirement, as well as those eligible for mentorship programs. The deliverables for this assignment were tables exported as csv files with the information requested. 

## Results 
There are several major conclusions that can be drawn from this project. The first is that Senior Engineers have the largest number of employees eligible for retirement. The second is that in general, senior positions are looking at higher rates of retirement eligibilty. Arguably this is because senior level positions require experience that employees at other levels have yet to acquire. Still, the large number of retirement eligibile senior employees could potentially impact productivity and organization in the negative. For this reason, it would be in the best interest of Pewlett-Hackard to have senior positions mentor their direct juniors. Another conlcusion we can draw from this data is that there is ample room for professional growth within Pewlett-Hackard. That there are only two employees eligible for retirement in the Manager position means that they are able to move upwards into more senior positions. 

## Summary
If we were to further develop this study, it would be interesting and relevant to see how much professional growth the company allows for, looking at employee's time in each position up to when they reach retirement eligibility. Another thing that may be interesting to further examine would be to look at how many employees have left and then returned, which could provide insight into how Pewlett-Hackard compares to its competition in the labor market.
